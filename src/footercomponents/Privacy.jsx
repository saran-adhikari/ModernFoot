                <p>When you make a purchase on our ModernFoot store, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, and email.
                <br/>
                    When you visit our ModernFoot store, we automatically receive your computer's internet protocol IP address to gather information that helps us understand your browser and operating system.
                <br/>
                    If you opt in for email marketing, we may send you emails about our store, new product releases, and updates, with your permission.

                    <h3>**SECTION 2 - CONSENT**</h3>

                <p>How do we obtain your consent?<br/>

                    By providing us with your personal information for transactional purposes (e.g., completing a purchase, verifying your payment method, arranging delivery or returns), you imply your consent for us to collect and use that information solely for the specified purpose.
                    <br/>
                    For secondary purposes like marketing, we will either ask for your direct consent or provide you with the option to decline.
                    <br/>
                    You can also provide consent for receiving automated marketing messages via text by checking the designated box. This consent is not required for making a purchase, and standard message and data rates may apply. You can opt-out at any time by texting STOP.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>How can you withdraw your consent?<br/>

                    If you change your mind after opting in, you can withdraw your consent for us to contact you or continue using your information at any time. Simply contact us at info@ModernFoot.com or mail us at:<br/>
